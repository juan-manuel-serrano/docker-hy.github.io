This is exercise 3.1 of the DevOps with Docker course.

Using the course material (with modifications), create a deployment pipeline to Heroku. To see the modifications, visit: https://github.com/juan-manuel-serrano/docker-hy.github.io

When a new commit is pushed to GitHub, have GitHub Actions deploy a webapp to Heroku.

The rest of the content on here is the same as the course, which can be found at https://devopswithdocker.com

# About this course

This course is an introductory course to Docker and docker-compose. The course will also look into what different parts web services consist of, such as reverse proxies, databases, etc. Docker can not be installed on faculty computers, so students will need to use their computers to follow the examples outlined in this course material and to complete the exercises.

### Prerequisites

Attendees need to have computers with admin/superuser privileges. Attendees are also expected to have a general understanding of software development and experience with a CLI of their choice.

## We've partnered with Eficode,
## the leading DevOps company in Europe
